# Chart (Dynamic Data Chart)

This project is an Angular application that uses **DevExtreme** to create an interactive line chart displaying dynamic data. The chart dynamically fetches data from a local JSON file and visually represents the information over time.

## Live Demo

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use DevExtreme components within an Angular application. It specifically showcases a line chart that plots dynamic data over time, dynamically loading data from a JSON file through an Angular service.

## Features

- **Interactive Chart**: The chart is fully interactive, allowing users to hover over data points for detailed information.
- **Dynamic Data Rendering**: Data is fetched dynamically from a JSON file and rendered on the chart, demonstrating how to integrate real-time or static data into an Angular component.
- **Customizable Chart Appearance**: The chart uses custom colors and formatting options to visually enhance the data representation.
- **Responsive Design**: The chart adjusts to different screen sizes, providing a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular 10.2.4**: A powerful front-end framework for building single-page applications.
- **Node.js 12.22.12**: The runtime environment required for running Angular CLI and managing dependencies.
- **DevExtreme 19.2.7**: A versatile UI component library that provides a range of advanced data visualization tools, including charts.
- **RxJS**: A library for reactive programming using observables, used to handle asynchronous data streams in Angular.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, used throughout the application.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the Dynamic Data Chart project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    - First, clone the repository from GitHub:

    ```

4. **Access the Application**:
    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the application.

## Usage

After launching the application:

- The chart will load automatically with data from the `chart.json` file located in the `assets` folder.
- The line chart visualizes the dynamic data over time.
- Hover over any data point on the chart to view detailed information about that point.

### Interactive Chart Features:

- **Tooltips**: Hover over any point on the chart to view the data value for that specific time period.
- **Legend**: The chart features a legend, indicating the data metric being visualized.

## Deployment

The project can be ready for deployment using the following steps:

1. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   ng build --prod --output-path docs --base-href /Chart/
